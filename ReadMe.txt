	PutItOnCB - ReadMe

"Put In On the ClipBoard" puts a fixed string on the system clipboard.

Program.cs is all of the code for this program. If you want to build the 
application, create a new C# .NET 3.5 'Console' app in Visual Studio. (This was
created using VS2010.) Replace the VS-generated Program.cs file with this one.
That's all there is to it. 

Note: No installation or uninstall is required. Just run the program on any
Windows system with the appropriate version of .NET.
